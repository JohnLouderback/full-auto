# YamlSchemaTypes

The purpose of this project is to generate YAML schemas from TypeScript type. The
generated YAML schemas can be used to validate YAML files. The purpose behind using
TypeScript types is that they're easier to write and maintain than JSON schemas and
they more closely resemble the actual data structures that the YAML files represent.
